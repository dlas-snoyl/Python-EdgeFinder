# Python-EdgeFinder
A simple image edge finder in Python using OpenCV and Tkinter. Inspired by a school project that performed the same actions but in C.

Input is the file name with the extension, be sure to have the files located in the same place as the program itself.

I used OpenCV to perform the actual edge finding algorithm and used Tkinter to provide a basic GUI. When I first made a edge finding program it did not have a GUI and I thought it would be nicer to have a easy way to interact with multiple files.
